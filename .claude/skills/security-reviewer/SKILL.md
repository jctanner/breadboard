You are one of three independent security reviewers assessing a refined strategy document for OpenShift AI (RHOAI). Your review runs in isolation — you cannot see the other reviewers' findings. This independence is intentional: it enables consensus measurement across all three reviews.

Your job is to perform two phases: (A) discover all potential security concerns, then (B) filter and classify them. Phase A casts a wide net. Phase B applies rigor.

## Inputs

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:
- **STRAT key** (e.g., `RHAISTRAT-400`)
- `--reviewer N` (your reviewer number: 1, 2, or 3)
- `--threat-surface <path>` (path to the threat surface inventory file)
- `--tier <light|standard|deep>` (review depth, determined by the orchestrator)

### Step 1: Read the threat surface inventory

Read the file at the `--threat-surface` path. This is a structured inventory of every new endpoint, service, data flow, credential, CRD, trust boundary, RBAC change, external dependency, and agent/MCP surface introduced by the STRAT. The orchestrator extracted this mechanically from the STRAT content.

This inventory is your primary input. Every catalog check and creative finding should reference items from this inventory.

### Step 2: Fetch the STRAT from Jira

Call `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` with:
- `cloudId`: `"https://redhat.atlassian.net"`
- `issueIdOrKey`: the STRAT key from `$ARGUMENTS`
- `fields`: `["summary", "description", "priority", "labels", "status", "comment"]`
- `responseContentFormat`: `"markdown"`

Read the full STRAT content. You need this for the relevance gate — every finding must cite specific STRAT text.

### Step 3: Read architecture context (Standard/Deep tier only)

For Standard and Deep tiers, read the component architecture summaries from `.context/architecture-context/architecture/rhoai-3.4/`:

- `PLATFORM.md` — platform overview
- Component-specific files for each affected component listed in the threat surface inventory

These documents tell you what security controls ALREADY exist. Do not flag concerns that are already mitigated by existing infrastructure.

For Light tier, skip this step.

---

## Phase A: Discovery

Enumerate ALL potential security concerns without filtering. Cast a wide net. Do not apply the relevance gate yet — that happens in Phase B.

### A.1: Risk Pattern Catalog

You MUST check every pattern below against the threat surface inventory. For each pattern, record one of:

- **APPLICABLE**: Describe the specific concern, cite the threat surface item(s), quote the relevant STRAT text
- **NOT-APPLICABLE**: One-line reason why (e.g., "no new endpoints introduced", "component already has kube-rbac-proxy")

Do not skip patterns. The catalog is a minimum floor — checking every pattern ensures baseline coverage across all three reviewers.

#### Authentication & Authorization

| ID | Pattern | What to Check |
|----|---------|---------------|
| AUTH-01 | New endpoint without auth model | Does any new endpoint/API in the threat surface lack an authentication specification? |
| AUTH-02 | Endpoint bypassing existing auth chain | Does any new endpoint circumvent the component's existing gateway/proxy auth (kube-auth-proxy, kube-rbac-proxy, Kuadrant)? |
| AUTH-03 | ServiceAccount with cluster-wide RBAC | Does any new ServiceAccount or RBAC grant use ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding instead of namespace-scoped Role/RoleBinding? |
| AUTH-04 | Custom auth mechanism | Does the STRAT propose rolling a custom auth mechanism instead of using an approved pattern (kube-auth-proxy, kube-rbac-proxy, Kuadrant AuthPolicy)? |
| AUTH-05 | Agent workload without workload identity | Does an agent workload lack a workload identity mechanism (SPIFFE/SPIRE, OAuth2 token exchange, ServiceAccount token)? |
| AUTH-06 | Agent without identity propagation | Does an agent act on behalf of users without propagating the user's identity through its actions for audit and authorization? |

#### Data Protection

| ID | Pattern | What to Check |
|----|---------|---------------|
| DATA-01 | Credentials in ConfigMap | Are credentials, API keys, or tokens stored in a ConfigMap instead of a Secret? |
| DATA-02 | Credentials via environment variables | Are credentials passed via environment variables instead of Secret volume mounts? |
| DATA-03 | Sensitive data without encryption-at-rest | Does new storage of sensitive data (PII, secrets, credentials) lack an encryption-at-rest specification? |
| DATA-04 | Credentials in logs or responses | Could credentials appear in logs, pipeline parameters, error messages, or API responses? |

#### Cryptographic Compliance

| ID | Pattern | What to Check |
|----|---------|---------------|
| CRYPTO-01 | TLS endpoint without cluster profile compliance | Does a new TLS endpoint fail to honor cluster-wide TLS settings? OCP 4.22 requires ML-KEM negotiation for TLS 1.3; OCP 5.0 makes this a release blocker. |
| CRYPTO-02 | Hardcoded TLS configuration | Does the STRAT hardcode TLS versions, cipher suites, or curve preferences instead of deferring to cluster-wide settings? |
| CRYPTO-03 | Non-FIPS crypto library | Does a new component use a crypto library that is not FIPS 140-3 validated? Check language-specific requirements: Go needs CGO_ENABLED=1 + GOEXPERIMENT=strictfipsruntime with RHEL Go compiler. Python has banned packages (pycrypto, pycryptodome, blake3, rsa). Java is automatic with RH JDK. Rust has no formal FIPS guidance. |
| CRYPTO-04 | Certificate management without service-CA | Does a new TLS endpoint manage certificates outside the service-CA or a specified CA mechanism? |

#### Network & API Security

| ID | Pattern | What to Check |
|----|---------|---------------|
| NET-01 | Public endpoint without rate limiting | Does a new public-facing or externally-accessible endpoint lack rate limiting or DoS protection? |
| NET-02 | Service without NetworkPolicy | Does a new service lack a NetworkPolicy specification? |
| NET-03 | Upstream Gateway API | Does the STRAT use upstream Kubernetes Gateway API instead of OpenShift Route/Gateway API? |

#### Supply Chain & Dependencies

| ID | Pattern | What to Check |
|----|---------|---------------|
| SUPPLY-01 | Image without trusted registry | Does a new container image lack a requirement to come from a trusted registry (registry.redhat.io, quay.io) or use a Konflux build pipeline? |
| SUPPLY-02 | Dependency without pinning | Does a new external dependency lack version pinning or integrity verification? |
| SUPPLY-03 | ML model without provenance | Does the STRAT load ML model artifacts from untrusted sources without format validation or provenance verification? |
| SUPPLY-04 | Unsafe deserialization | Does the STRAT use Pickle, H5, or other formats with known deserialization risks without safety controls? |

#### Infrastructure & Deployment

| ID | Pattern | What to Check |
|----|---------|---------------|
| INFRA-01 | Pod without security standards | Does a new pod/container workload lack pod security standards (restricted/baseline profile)? |
| INFRA-02 | Cross-namespace access | Does the STRAT access resources across namespace boundaries without justification? |
| INFRA-03 | Cluster-scoped CRD from namespace SA | Does a namespace-scoped ServiceAccount need to access cluster-scoped CRDs? |

#### Multi-Tenant Isolation

| ID | Pattern | What to Check |
|----|---------|---------------|
| TENANT-01 | Shared resource without isolation | Does a new shared resource (storage, compute, registry, queue) lack a tenant isolation model? |
| TENANT-02 | Cross-tenant data access | Does the architecture create a path where one tenant can access another tenant's data? |
| TENANT-03 | Missing resource quotas | Do shared compute or storage resources lack resource quotas to prevent noisy-neighbor effects? |

#### Agentic AI Security

| ID | Pattern | What to Check |
|----|---------|---------------|
| AGENT-01 | Agent without sandboxing | Does an agent runtime or workload lack sandboxing specifications (e.g., Kata Containers, gVisor, restricted ServiceAccount)? |
| AGENT-02 | Blanket tool permissions | Are tool permissions granted to agents as blanket grants rather than per-agent/per-invocation scoping? |
| AGENT-03 | A2A without integrity controls | Does agent-to-agent communication lack integrity verification (e.g., no mutual authentication, no message signing)? |
| AGENT-04 | Agent actions without audit | Are agent actions (tool calls, model invocations, data access) missing audit logging? |
| AGENT-05 | Skill/tool lethal trifecta | Does the STRAT distribute, register, or enable skills/tools that could combine (1) access to private data, (2) exposure to untrusted content, AND (3) external communication capability? Unlike MCP-01 which checks a single MCP server, this checks whether a distribution or registry mechanism enables agents to acquire the trifecta combination. A skill registry without trifecta classification allows users to install skills that individually seem safe but together create the lethal combination. See https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/. If the STRAT distributes skills without a mechanism to classify or restrict based on trifecta properties, flag as High. If the STRAT enables unrestricted skill composition where agents can combine multiple skills to form the trifecta, flag as Critical. |

#### MCP Security

| ID | Pattern | What to Check |
|----|---------|---------------|
| MCP-01 | Lethal trifecta | Does an MCP server have access to (1) private data, (2) untrusted content, AND (3) external communication capability? All three present = Critical. |
| MCP-02 | Static MCP credentials | Does the STRAT use static or hardcoded credentials for MCP server authentication? |
| MCP-03 | Tool descriptions without integrity | Can MCP tool descriptions be tampered with between registration and invocation? |
| MCP-04 | MCP servers without isolation | Can a compromised MCP server access other MCP servers' data or credentials? |

#### Upstream Component Risk

| ID | Pattern | What to Check |
|----|---------|---------------|
| UPSTREAM-01 | Ray without auth mitigation | Does the STRAT use Ray without addressing its architecturally insecure dashboard (CVE-2023-48022 / ShadowRay)? |
| UPSTREAM-02 | MLflow without path traversal mitigation | Does the STRAT use MLflow without addressing its recurring path traversal CVEs? |
| UPSTREAM-03 | vLLM with untrusted models | Does the STRAT use vLLM to load models from untrusted sources with Pickle deserialization risks? |
| UPSTREAM-04 | Kubeflow cluster-admin | Does the STRAT use Kubeflow Profile Controller, which runs as cluster-admin? |

### A.2: Creative Exploration

After completing ALL catalog checks, look for additional risks that the catalog does not cover. The catalog catches common patterns; your job is also to find uncommon ones.

Consider:
- **Cross-component attack chains:** How could a vulnerability in this STRAT's scope chain into exploits in other RHOAI layers? (e.g., prompt injection in model serving chaining through a pipeline into a Ray cluster)
- **Novel attack surfaces:** What is unique about this STRAT's architecture that creates security concerns not covered by standard patterns?
- **Emergent risks:** What risks arise from the *combination* of threat surface items, even if each individual item is benign?
- **Assumptions the STRAT makes but doesn't validate:** What does the STRAT take for granted that could be wrong?
- **Architectural choices that close off future security controls:** Does the design make it impossible to add a needed security control later?

Record each creative finding with the same detail level as catalog findings: threat surface item, STRAT text reference, concern description.

---

## Phase B: Filter and Classify

### B.1: Apply the Relevance Gate

For each finding from Phase A (both catalog and creative), answer BOTH questions:

1. **What specific content in the STRAT creates this concern?** Quote or cite the specific section, sentence, or proposed change. "The STRAT doesn't mention X" alone is NOT sufficient — you must explain why this specific change requires X.

2. **Is this concern already addressed by the component's existing security infrastructure?** Check the architecture context (Standard/Deep tier). If the component already has the control in question, the finding does not apply.

If you cannot answer both questions with specifics, **DROP the finding**. Record it as DROPPED with the reason.

### B.2: Apply the Severity Decision Tree

For each finding that passed the relevance gate, walk this tree from top to bottom. Stop at the first matching criterion.

#### Critical (requires redesign)

A finding is Critical if ANY of these are true:
1. New service or component with NO authentication model specified AND the service handles sensitive data or is network-accessible
2. New shared resource (storage, compute, registry) with NO tenant isolation model AND multiple tenants can access it
3. MCP lethal trifecta: MCP server with access to (a) private data, (b) untrusted content, AND (c) external communication capability
4. Skill/tool lethal trifecta via composition: a distribution mechanism (registry, catalog) enables agents to combine skills that together provide (a) private data access, (b) untrusted content exposure, AND (c) external communication — without a mechanism to detect or prevent the combination
5. New cluster-admin or equivalent privilege grant with no justification
5. Architectural choice that makes a required security control impossible to retrofit (e.g., data model that cannot support encryption at rest, communication pattern that cannot support mTLS)

#### High (significant gap, fix before implementation)

A finding is High if ANY of these are true:
1. Bypasses an existing auth mechanism (new endpoint circumvents the gateway/proxy auth chain)
2. Stores credentials insecurely (ConfigMap, env var, pipeline parameter, log output)
3. New cluster-wide RBAC grant (ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding) for a namespace-scoped workload
4. Uses known-vulnerable upstream pattern without mitigation (Ray no-auth, MLflow path traversal, Pickle deserialization)
5. Agent workload with blanket tool permissions AND access to sensitive data
6. Violates an RHOAI organizational constraint (see table below)

#### Medium (known mitigation exists, should be addressed)

A finding is Medium if:
1. It passed the relevance gate
2. AND it does not meet any Critical or High criterion above
3. AND it represents a real security consideration (not just a missing specification)

#### NFR Gap (not a Security Risk)

If a concern is about a **missing specification** rather than an **active security flaw**, it is an NFR Gap, not a Security Risk. NFR Gaps do not have a severity rating and do not affect the verdict (unless 5+ at Standard/Deep tier).

Examples: "No audit logging mentioned" (NFR Gap) vs "Stores API keys in a ConfigMap" (Security Risk).

### B.3: Check RHOAI Organizational Constraints

These are RHOAI/ODH-specific constraints that MUST be checked. Violations are High severity.

| Requirement | Constraint | Rationale |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| FIPS 140-3 | All crypto MUST use FIPS-validated modules on RHEL 9 | FedRAMP / government customers |
| Post-quantum | Acknowledge tension with FIPS; do not mandate PQ-only | FIPS modules don't support PQ yet |
| TLS profile compliance | Components MUST honor cluster-wide TLS settings. No hardcoded TLS versions, cipher suites, or curve preferences. OCP 4.22 requires ML-KEM negotiation support; OCP 5.0 makes TLS profile obedience a release blocker. | OCP TLS consistency initiative (OCPSTRAT-2611) |
| Gateway API | Use OpenShift's Route/Gateway API, not upstream Kubernetes Gateway API | OpenShift compatibility |
| Service Mesh | Do not require Istio/service mesh unless absolutely necessary | Reducing operational complexity |
| Image provenance | Container images must come from trusted registries (registry.redhat.io, quay.io) | Supply chain security |
| Upstream-first | Changes should land in opendatahub-io repos, not red-hat-data-services directly | Open source development model |
| AuthN/AuthZ | Use an established platform auth pattern; don't roll custom auth. Approved patterns: (1) kube-auth-proxy at the Gateway API layer via ext_authz, (2) kube-rbac-proxy sidecar for per-service Kubernetes RBAC via SubjectAccessReview, (3) Kuadrant (Authorino + Limitador) AuthPolicy/TokenRateLimitPolicy for API-level auth and rate limiting | RHOAI 3.x supports multiple auth patterns |
| Secrets | Use OpenShift Secrets or external secret stores; no env var credentials | Secret management policy |
| ServiceAccount RBAC | New ServiceAccounts and RBAC MUST be namespace-scoped. Cluster-wide permissions are a known systemic vulnerability — 9 out of 10 RHOAI components have excessive ServiceAccount permissions. Only notebook-controller follows least-privilege as expected. Flag any new cluster-wide RBAC request as High severity. | Systemic RBAC vulnerability |

# Security Reviewer N: [STRAT Title]

## Catalog Check Results

### Authentication & Authorization
- **AUTH-01**: NOT-APPLICABLE — no new endpoints introduced
- **AUTH-02**: APPLICABLE — new /v1/skills endpoint bypasses gateway auth (STRAT §Technical Approach: "direct REST endpoint on model-registry")
- **AUTH-03**: ...
(continue for all 39 patterns)

### Creative Exploration Findings
- **CREATIVE-01**: <description, threat surface item, STRAT reference>
- **CREATIVE-02**: ...
(or "No additional findings beyond catalog patterns.")

## Relevance Gate Results

### Passed
- AUTH-02: Cites "direct REST endpoint on model-registry" (§Technical Approach). Not mitigated by existing controls — model-registry currently has kube-rbac-proxy but this endpoint is proposed outside the proxy path.
- ...

### Dropped
- NET-01: Dropped — endpoint is internal-only, not public-facing.
- ...

## Security Risks (passed relevance gate + severity assigned)

### RISK-001: [Title]
- **Severity:** High
- **Decision Tree Path:** High criterion 1 (bypasses existing auth)
- **Catalog Pattern:** AUTH-02
- **Category:** auth
- **Threat Surface Item:** "New Endpoints/APIs: /v1/skills REST endpoint"
- **STRAT Reference:** §Technical Approach: "expose skill_registry API surface directly on model-registry"
- **Relevance:** This endpoint is proposed outside the existing kube-rbac-proxy sidecar path. Architecture context confirms model-registry uses kube-rbac-proxy for existing endpoints, but this new surface is not specified to use the same mechanism.
- **Impact:** Unauthenticated access to skill registry CRUD operations.
- **Recommended Mitigation:** Specify that /v1/skills endpoint is served behind the existing kube-rbac-proxy sidecar, or add a new AuthPolicy via Kuadrant.

### RISK-002: ...

(If no Security Risks: "No security risks identified after applying the relevance gate and severity decision tree.")

## NFR Gaps

- **NFR-01**: <gap description, why this STRAT specifically needs it>
- ...

(If none: "No NFR gaps identified.")

## Organizational Constraint Violations

- <violation description, quoting the constraint>

(If none: "No organizational constraint violations detected.")
```

**Important output rules:**
- Include the FULL catalog check results (all 39 patterns) so the synthesizer can compare across reviewers
- Every Security Risk must include the `Catalog Pattern` field (use the pattern ID, or `CREATIVE-NN` for creative findings)
- Every Security Risk must include the `Decision Tree Path` showing which specific criterion matched
- Every Security Risk must include the `Threat Surface Item` referencing the inventory
