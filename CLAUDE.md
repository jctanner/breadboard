# AI-First Pipeline

AI-driven pipeline for triaging, analyzing, and fixing RHOAI (Red Hat OpenShift AI) engineering bugs, managing RFEs, and developing strategies. Uses Claude Agent SDK on Vertex AI to orchestrate multi-phase workflows against Jira.

## Quick Reference

```bash
uv sync                                    # Install dependencies
python main.py <command> [options]          # Run a pipeline phase
python main.py dashboard --port 5000       # Launch web dashboard
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- `uv` package manager
- Google Cloud credentials (Vertex AI)
- Jira access (REST API token)
- Podman (for patch validation only)

## Environment

Create `.env` in the project root (gitignored):

```

CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5
ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=<gcp-project-id>
JIRA_SERVER=https://issues.redhat.com
JIRA_USER=<email>
JIRA_TOKEN=<api-token>
ATLASSIAN_MCP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8081/sse   # optional MCP server
```

### Generated Directories (gitignored)
- `issues/` - Fetched Jira JSON and phase output files
- `workspace/` - Cloned midstream repos per issue + model-specific outputs
- `logs/` - Structured activity logs (`activity.jsonl`) and phase logs
- `artifacts/security-reviews/` - Full analytical security reviews (on-disk reference)
- `artifacts/security-requirements/` - Actionable security requirements (attached to Jira)

## Architecture

### Skill System

Skills are defined as `SKILL.md` files containing agent instructions. Two invocation methods:

- **Templated** - SKILL.md content injected directly into agent prompt (bug analysis phases). Deterministic and batch-friendly.
- **Native** - Agent uses SDK skill discovery via `Skill` tool. Used for RFE/strategy phases where agents need the full external repo context (CLAUDE.md, scripts, sub-skills).

Configuration lives in `pipeline-skills.yaml`, which maps each phase to its skill, source repo, invocation method, and allowed tools.

### Workspace Model

Each bug issue gets: `workspace/{ISSUE_KEY}/{model_id}/`
- `src/` - Cloned midstream (opendatahub-io) repo
- `{phase}.json` - Structured output (validated against JSON Schema)
- `{phase}.md` - Human-readable output
- `{phase}.log` - Agent execution log

Invalid outputs are renamed to `*.invalid` and don't block re-runs.

### Repo Mapping

Three-tier contribution model: upstream -> midstream (opendatahub-io) -> downstream (Red Hat).
Fixes always target midstream. `[lib/repo_mapping.py](lib/repo_mapping.py)` resolves names across tiers.

### Validation Loop

Fix attempts can be validated in Podman containers using `odh-tests-context` recipes. On failure, validation feedback is injected into a retry prompt for self-correction (configurable retries via `--validation-retries`).

### Dashboard

Flask app with PicoCSS + vanilla JS. Tabs for bugs, RFEs, and strategies. Real-time activity feed via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Launch with `python main.py dashboard`.

### Concurrency

Phases run agents in parallel via asyncio semaphore. Default 5 concurrent agents. Activity events pushed to the dashboard for live monitoring.

## Key Conventions

- All phase outputs are validated against JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) defined in `[lib/schemas.py](lib/schemas.py)`
- RFE/strategy artifacts use YAML frontmatter for structured metadata
- The `--model` flag determines the workspace subdirectory path for bug phases
- MCP servers (e.g., Atlassian) are configured per-phase in `pipeline-skills.yaml`
- Jira projects: `RHOAIENG` (bugs), `RHAIRFE` (RFEs), `RHAISTRAT` (strategies)

## Development Notes

- `[lib/phases.py](lib/phases.py)` is the largest module (~3,300 lines) containing all phase orchestration logic
- `lib/webapp.py` (~180KB) contains inline Jinja2 templates via DictLoader
- The `.context/` directory holds git-cloned architecture docs; these are not checked in
- `remote_skills/rfe-creator/` is a separate git repo cloned into place; it has its own `CLAUDE.md`
